# Hello, I'm Thomas Angelo Pinataro! This is my presonal website. 

I am a software engineering student and am building expertise in full-stack web development. I love solving problems, coffee, food, people, fitness and travel. I am continuously learning, involved in the local tech community and curious about artificial intelligence, the cloud, bots, virtual/augmented reality, machine learning, data science, robotics, and all the new opportunities technology offers us.
